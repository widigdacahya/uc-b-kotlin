    /*
    * [COLLECTION]
    *  > List
    *   Ordered Collection
    *   Element can be accessed by the position(index)
    *   Can contain duplicate element
    *   Example : A sentence is a list of words, they gave an order and can be repeated
    *
    *  > Set
    *   Group of unique elements
    *   The order has no significance
    *   we could fo through the element, one by one(iterate over them but the order is not defined)
    *   Example : A deck of card
    *
    *  > Map
    *   a set of key-value pairs
    *   Keys are unique(set)
    *   Each key mapt to exactly one value
    *   value can be duplicate
    *   Example : a Dictionary where each Maps word to definitions
    *
    * ----Iterator, an object that loops through elements of a collection
    *     this gonna be useful when applying the sam operation to all elements
